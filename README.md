These tasks are a demonstration of the skills and competencies that I have developed over the course of this bootcamp. Many of these represent the basic use of python to deal with inputs, for loops and use of libraries such as Numpy and Seaborn. 
Later tasks focus on data processing (including EDA, preprocessing and visualisation) and machine learning (Linear, multilinear and logistic regression,

## Basic programming principles
**[Task 6 - _User-defined functions_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%206)**

  Created user defined functions to provide the cost of a holiday including: cost of flights, hotels and car hire. 
  Functions were used to enable a user to input the location that they are flying from, number of nights in their     hotel and the number of days that they need car hire for. 

**[Task 7 - _Handling strings, lists and dictionaries_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%207)**

  Basic experience of using dictionaries and lists to complete a stock taking task. Used a for loop and basic         mathematical functions to calculate the value of stock from a few items in a cafe.


**[Task 8 - _I/O operations_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%208)** 

  Learning to read text files into a program and use list creation and modification to store and print information information from  a source. Student_registers task is creating a document for students to sign for an exam. 
  Makes use of for loops and list comprehension to order and present the information. 

**[Task 9 - _Object Oriented Programming - Classes_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%209)**

Creation of classes and functions, using an email organiser as a task. Methods are used to define the functions that are used in popuklating the inbox, liast the emails and identify if the whether an email has been read from the inbox.   

## Working with data

**[Task 11 -  _Datastes and dataframes_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2011)** 

Working with dataframes including finding ways to identify and select certain rowns and columns using .iloc[:]


**[Task 12 - _Data visualisation_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2012)** 

Basics of data visualisation using Seaborn and Matplotlib for the 'Cars93' dataset. Creating and analysing box plots, histograms, line and bar plots.  

**[Task 13 - _Data cleaning_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2013)** 

Manipulating and cleaning data in a dataframe. Using .strip(), .lower() etc. for initial cleaning of unformated country labels. 
Basic use of Fuzzywuzzy to identify close matches and similarity between database inputs. 

**[Task 14 - _Data preprocessing_]()** 

**[Task 15 - _Exploratory data analysis_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2015)**

Data pre-processing and EDA task. Identifying which columns to keep for analysis, encoding binary features using LabelEncoder(). 
Used heatmaps to identify correlation between features and using this to design plots for analysis. 

## Machine learning
**[Task 17 - _Simple linear regression and machine learning_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2017%20-%20Linear%20regression)**

Preprocessing data to allow linear regression to be conducted on the 'Titanic' dataset. The instructions required an analyisis of a binary variable, reulsting in sub-optimal results which have been identified in the task. 
MinMaxScaler() has been employed for developing training and testing sets for the linear regression to be applied. 

**[Task 18 - _Multiple linear regression_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2018%20-%20Multiple%20linear%20regression)**

**[Task 19 - _Logistic regression_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2019%20-%20Logistic%20regression)**

**[Task 20 - _Decision trees_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2020%20-%20Decision%20trees)**

**[Task 21 - _Random Forests_](https://github.com/S-Humble/Bootcamp-code-examples/tree/main/Tasks/Task%2021%20-%20Random%20forests)**
